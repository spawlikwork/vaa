## Background
Each day across VA clinical staff use a suite of VistA Applications (VistA clients) to create and process over 50 million clinical documents, orders, labs, images, reminders, and transactions in VistA. All VistA Applications process their transactions remotely on VistA via remote procedure calls. In aggregate, these remote procedure calls (RPCs) between VistA clients and VistA describe all clinical care transactions and workflows performed at VHA medical centers.

#### VistA Application Analysis
The VistA Application Analysis team will analyze *all traffic* of *all VistA clients* of *all users* of three VistA systems. 
The Analysis Team shall also provide *inter-VistA traffic analysis*  distinguishing common VistA traffic patterns from VistA-specific traffic patterns.

Traffic Analysis for each VistA shall characterize:  
a)	User volume  
b)	Client types and volume of use  
c)	Connection volumes, frequency, and duration  
d)	Types of user authentication/security and relative use  
e)	Machine from end Users  
f)	RPC usage frequency and execution times  
g)	RPC groupings – representing transactions  
h)	RPCs specific to a VistA from cross-VistA RPCs  

Deliverables:  
A.	Traffic Analysis Reports for three production VistAs  
B.	Cross VistA Traffic Analysis Report


#### VistA Client Traffic Analysis
Based on the traffic and client types isolated in the VistA traffic analysis, the Analysis Team will analyze the operation of three of the most used VistA Applications ("Clients"). 
CPRS shall be one of the three; the remaining two shall be chosen based on client usage.  

The per Client Traffic Analysis will include:  
a)	User volumes and types. User types shall capture clinical care specialties and roles.  
b)	Connection volume and duration, tying frequency of client use to user types  
c)	Types of user authentication/security and relative use  
d)	Patient volumes  
e)	Enumeration of all RPCs used by a client and their relative use  
f)	Distinction of clinical from non-clinical RPCs  
g)	Distinction of RPCs that change (write) from those that read the clinical record  
h)	Distinction of slow running, high overhead and variable overhead RPCs  
i)	Clinical care task sets, represented as groups of RPCs used to perform specific clinical tasks  
j)	Match task sets with the use of one or more specific client screens  
k)	Task sets employed by different user types  (nursing, physician, and all identifiable specialties)
l)	Isolate performance issues with patterns of use that slow care  
m)	Verification and validation that the analysis accurately captures care provision  


## Use Cases
Below are real-world uses cases where VistA Application Analytics can provide detailed actionable information. 
(This list continues to expand over time)

__Efficiency__     
1. COVER SHEET tab within CPRS associated with significant lag and latency, which may lead to end users setting default landing tab in EHR to another tab (such as NOTES tab).  High thresholds exist to access COVER SHEET tab within workflow, such as to review due clinical reminders, future scheduled appointments, or vitals package details.
2. The process of converting a Visit Pending Note to a signable progress note within CPRS is associated with significant lag and latency within multiple aspects of this specific workflow.
3. Certain large national TIU note templates when accessed are associated with significant lag and latency.  One example is the Traveling and Relocating Veteran Coordinator consult.
4. The Alert When Results feature within CPRS can be an effective strategy to become alerted of specific, selected and targeted consult/test results.  However, there is considerable lag and latency associated with results populating within a separate pop-up window when this alert is selected for review.
5. The Log in process for CPRS in general can be combersome. When an end user first attemps to load CPRS, they receive no feedback within the client workstation that indicates the application is loading.  This lack of feedback often leads the end user to believe that the load request was unsuccessful, which may prompt another attempt to double click the icon to load the application.  If this happens, the end user will eventually have two separate sessions of CPRS loading, which is not desirable. Subsequently, when the PIV authentication for CPRS happens as a necessary step in the load process, this pop up window is MINIMIZED within the client workstation, behind other open applications.  This often leads to the end user not being aware that a PIV authentication request for CPRS loading is open, which can lead to a failed CPRS load attempt due to the session being timeed out.  So the end user is left with a dilemma, when loading CPRS: essentially stop all other activities to vigilantly monitor for the PIV authentication of CPRS, which can take several moments to display, or choose to multitask while the load attempt is ongoing, with the knowledge that a PIV authentication opportunity may be timed out if not recognized, requiring the entire workflow to load CPRS to be initiated again.


## Analytics Approach
To provide a modern, centralized cloud-based platform for veteran healthcare delivery, VA has migrated all VistA systems to the VA Enterprise Cloud, a federally certified commercial cloud managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). By itsself, this migration ("lift-and-shift") of VistA to the AWS Cloud does not change VistA or any end-user functionality. However, VistA's new platform in the AWS Cloud provides over 200 new features and capabilities to VistA that can be used to improve veteran care quality, efficiency, and access. (See: [AWS Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/introduction.html))

</p>

By leveraging VistA's new AWS cloud-based traffic streaming capability, VHA has the first-ever opportunity to comprehensively analyze the clinical workflows of all staff at VA medical centers.  Such analysis would drive improved standards of practice by health care providers. These improvements would be prompted by the actual practice of care and not speculation about how care is being provided.


#### Workflow Capture
All VistA Application workflows (RPC traffic flows) of cloud-based VistA are streamed to cloud storage using the built-in traffic mirroring service in the AWS Cloud.

## Overview of Analysis
The Vista Application Analytics project will engage VistA data experts to analyze the RPC traffic between VistA clients and three representative Cloud VistA servers.   The analysis will be provided in a series of precise reports, detailing different aspect of VA care. Analysis will include the types and volumes of structured and unstructured information read and written by clearly identified classes of health care professional as well as the range of time spent on different tasks.  

On completion, VHA will possess a set of concrete, actionable recommendations, and demonstrations for improving the care provided to Veterans as well as a guide for how to perform such analysis in the future. 



#### Workflow Analytics
Using the RPC traffic captured, multiple parallel analyses will occur.
1. __Composite Analysis__: Simple and filtered analysis of *all* traffic from *all* users for *all*  applications of a specific VistA server. This provides *screen metrics* to be used in the VistA application-specific analysis.
2. __Sequence Analysis__: Identify and classify the longest common sequences (LCS) of RPCs generated by a given VistA Application. These LCS correspond to the *actual workflow* of end-users of a given VistA Application.
3. __Workflow Analysis__: The Vista Documentation Library (VDL) contains the User Guides for VistA Applications, which is the *documented workflow* of VistA Applications. The documentation and screenshots of specific VistA Applications are parsed and classified in a standardized computable form to permit analysis.
4. __Workflow Correlation Analysis__ - Correlate the (1) Actual screens generated by live users of a VistA Application (2) Documented screens based on the VDL descriptions for specific VistA Applications (3) Actual workflow - based on the LCS analyss of known RPCs an their fuction.

B.	Cross VistA Traffic Analysis Report


### Key VistA Client traffic analysis

Based on the traffic and client types isolated during the VistA traffic analysis, the Analysis Team shall produce a detailed Client Traffic Analysis of the operation of three of the most used VistA Applications ("Clients"). CPRS shall be one of the three; the remaining two shall be chosen based on client usage.   

All client analyses must be validated and verifiable in a demonstrable way, matching RPC flows to specific client screens and typical tasks. The Analysis Team shall document the verification and validation of the analysis and provide a Client Traffic Analysis Validation and Verification Report. 

The per Client Traffic Analysis shall include:  
a)	User volumes and types. User types shall capture clinical care specialties and roles.  
b)	Connection volume and duration, tying frequency of client use to user types  
c)	Types of user authentication/security and relative use  
d)	Patient volumes  
e)	Enumeration of all RPCs used by a client and their relative use  
f)	Distinction of clinical from non-clinical RPCs  
g)	Distinction of RPCs that change (write) from those that read the clinical record  
h)	Distinction of slow running, high overhead and variable overhead RPCs  
i)	Clinical care task sets, represented as groups of RPCs used in tandem  
j)	Match task sets with the use of one or more specific client screens  
k)	Task sets employed by different user types  
l)	Isolate performance issues with patterns of use that slow care  
m)	Verification and validation that the analysis accurately captures care provision  

Deliverables:  
A.	Three (3)  VistA Client Use Analysis Reports  
B.	Client Analysis Validation and Verification Report


Note: This task requires the Analysis Team to match the RPC traffic flows to client screens and tasks.  There is a unique RPC sequence associated with each task (login, logoff, ordering a medication, ordering a lab, writing notes, etc.). There will be thousands of unique RPC sequence - one for each interaction / task.   The Analysis Team must demonstrate that the matching of these RPC sequences to specific screens and tasks are complete and correct.


### VistA Client Use Improvement

Based solely on the Client Use Analysis Reports, the Analysis Team shall provide recommendations to upgrade the use of the top three RPC-using VistA Clients to deliver better clinical care. These recommendations shall be documented in Client Use Improvement Reports.

Deliverables:  
A.	Client Use Improvement Reports  


Note: This task requires the Analysis Team to provide recommendations to upgrade CPRS (and two other clients) to deliver better clinical care (more safe, more efficient, etc). These recommendations must come from soley the clinical workflow (RPC flows) analysis.
